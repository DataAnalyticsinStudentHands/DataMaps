# DataMaps

This is a development repository.

## Prerequisites

* We are running with a local [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/)

On Mac OS install via [homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

`brew install mongodb`

* [meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install)

On Mac OS or Linux:

`curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`

* Data Folder: It expects a certain data folder structure. `/hnet/incoming/current` + `/hnet/outgoing/current` should exist.

For pushing data out the server is using [lftp](https://lftp.yar.ru/) which must be installed.


## Getting started

You may have to run the following:
* `meteor npm install --save highcharts`
* `meteor npm install --save ftps`
* `meteor npm install --save junk`
* `meteor npm install --save fs-extra`

## Testing in local development environment

`MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/DataMaps meteor`

For debugging with node inspector run `MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/DataMaps meteor debug` and open the app in Chrome with the port listed once the app has started.

## Deployment with PM2

* change into the working directory and run `meteor build .` - this will generate a *.tar .gz file
* move the file to the install location nd extract it (you will end up with a `bundle` directory
* `cd bundle/programs/server/` and `npm install`
* generate a configuration file for PM2 (see example [gist](https://gist.github.com/fcbee3b520b4fdf97552.git)) outside of bundle
* run `pm2 start [your_pm2_conf_file]`
